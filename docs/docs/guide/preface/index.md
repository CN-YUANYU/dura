# 💁‍♀️ Affinity

At the beginning, we always adhered to the basic principle of **affinity**, and the so-called **affinity** means that we will be as compatible with the open source ecosystem as possible. You will not sacrifice your right to use other peripheral products in the ecology because of dura.

# 🐷 Ease of use

We hope that every friend can program happily, so we draw on a lot of excellent practices in the community, and are determined to implement business functions with the simplest API under the **90%** conventional business scenario.

# 🌴 Naturalness

We follow as far as possible not to create new and inexplicable programming concepts. We hope that **what you think is what you think, natural and taken for granted**

# 🚓 Safety

I hope that dura can help you write more robust and secure code.
