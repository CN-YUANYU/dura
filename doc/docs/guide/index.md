# What is dura?

Dura, I call it **嘟啦**，this is a state machine based on [redux](https://redux.js.org/) and developed and constructed using [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which simplifies the state management of **90%** of regular business scenarios.

Dura was born in a huge project with a pure front-end business code line reaching **million level**.

Since the birth of dura, as of the time you read this document, a total of 4 major versions have been released, dura1.x-dura3.x I have been committed to providing complete **type inferences**. And dura4.x will be a brave attempt. I try to implement a set of **dependency collection** based on redux, so as to avoid cumbersome **connect** behavior and make dura more intelligent.

# Next-generation dura development plan (dura 4)

- 😺 More friendly ts type deduction
- 😁 Complete dependency collection
- 🚀 Perfect hooks api support
- 📱 State machine watch mechanism
- 💻 State machine computed mechanism
- 🧱 More friendly support for micro front end
- 👬 Friendly support from multiple stores
- 😮 A new design mechanism for auto-loaing (supports different keys for the same effect to distinguish the loading status)
- 🚗 State machine built-in dynamically configurable throttling and anti-shake
- 🍳 Friendly bind mechanism (like vue two-way data binding)
- 🔧 Luban unified packaging and testing logic
